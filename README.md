# 🧮 Simple Calculator — JavaScript Project

A clean, responsive, and fully functional **web-based calculator** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.
This project focuses on core JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and UI interaction while maintaining a minimal and modern design.

## ✨ Features

* 🔢 Basic arithmetic operations

  * Addition (+)
  * Subtraction (−)
  * Multiplication (×)
  * Division (÷)
  * Modulus (%)

* 🧹 **AC (All Clear)** — Reset entire display

* ⌫ **Backspace** — Remove last character

* 🔘 Double zero (`00`) input support

* 🔵 Decimal calculations

* 🚫 Prevents multiple operators in sequence

* ⚠️ Handles invalid expressions (`Undefined`)

* 📱 Fully responsive layout

## ⚙️ How It Works

* Each button contains a `data-value` attribute.
* JavaScript captures button clicks via event listeners.
* Inputs are appended to the display dynamically.
* Operators are validated to avoid duplicates.
* Final expressions are evaluated using `eval()`.

## 🧠 Input Handling Logic

| Case                          | Behavior               |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Operator on empty display     | Ignored                |
| Multiple operators            | Replaces last operator |
| Decimal at start              | Converts to `0.`       |
| Backspace                     | Removes last character |
| Invalid ending operator + `=` | Shows `Undefined`      |

## 🎨 UI Highlights

* Circular modern buttons
* Hover & click animations
* Responsive grid layout
* Scrollable display for long expressions
* Dark theme calculator body
